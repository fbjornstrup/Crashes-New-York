title: Machine Learning Model

In this section, we will take a look at a Machine Learning model called a Random Forest Classifier. The purpose of this is to let the model predict whether or not a collision results in an injury or not. The model uses the same data set with the 10000 observations.

Below are two different plots. The first one shows feature importance of the most important feature, meaning the model has chosen these features as the most impactful when deciding whether a collision is severe or not. So look out for these yourselves!

So you should not drive a bike in the city, and really take into consideration when you move around in the traffic. 

The next one is basically the same, but this time it is with different weather measures as well. This makes some changes to which features are important, so consider these as well.

You can clearly see the weather has an impact on traffic collisions. Make sure that you check the weather forecast as this contributes to whether there will be a severe accident or not. Also the temperature is important, and let's just agree that there is no reason to take a bike around New York City.


Overall the Machine Learning model agrees with our earlier analysis, so take this information with you when you go to New York. It may make a difference on how well your trip is going to be.
