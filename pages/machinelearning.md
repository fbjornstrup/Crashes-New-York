title: Machine Learning Model

As the last section, we will take a look at a Machine Learning model called a Random Forest Classifier. The purpose of this is to let the model predict whether or not a collision results in an injury or not. The model uses the same data set as everything you have seen so far.

Below is two different plots. The first one shows feature importance of the mot important feature, meaning the model has chosen these features as the most impactful when deciding whether a collision is severe or not. So look out for these yourselves!

So you should not drive... and

The next one is basically the same, but this time it is with different weather measures as well. This makes some changes to which features are important, so consider these as well.
