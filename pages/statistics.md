It seems that the number of crashes has been increasing slowly up until COVID-19 as 2020 has much less collisions. So in terms of being in a car collision in NY, it seems that you are safer now than ever before. Maybe it is time for that vacation, unless something else is holding you back.

Luckily the numbers of deaths from car crashes is extremely small, and is nearly insignificant compared to the total amount of crashes happening. This is probably due to the relative slow pays that people are driving at in New York. However serious and lifelong lasting injuries may still occur.

Take a look at the timeline. Being an early bird or staying up late reduce the risk of being in a car collision. Seeing the city between 10 PM to around 9 AM is the safest time to go sightseeing in a vehicle.

If you are actually on the road getting from A to B, make sure to be extra careful around drivers looking at their phone. The most common reason why people are injured in car crashes in NY is because a driver of a sedan,  a station wagon or a SUV is distracted from actually driving.
